                  <h2>Sophie Lee</h2>
                  <p>" The summer of 2010 was one to remember. My sister and I, Elementary School students as the time, had worked the entire year to be Honorol Roll Students with one mutual goal in mind: a puppy. After obtaining a few impresssive Report Cards are end of the bargain was held up and we were met with our reward. Sophie Lee came into our lives."
