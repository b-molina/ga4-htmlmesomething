                  <h2>Sophie Lee</h2>
                  <p id="testP"> It was the summer of 2010 in Sunny Jacksonville, Florida. My sister and I, Elementary School students as the time, had worked the entire year to be Honorol Roll Students with one mutual goal in mind: a puppy. After obtaining a few impresssive Report Cards by the end of the school year, our end of the bargain was held up and we were met with our reward. Sophie Lee came into our lives.

                        > We spent the summer in LOVE. Within a few weeks she knew sit,stay, lie down, say hello and High-5. Our girl was smart. The summer passed and  a few years later, a move led us to a much chillier Virginia.

                  <h2>Reese</h2>
                  <p class="funParagraph"> Glen Allen, Virginia was now home and our then puppy Sophie Lee was now 6 years old. Thanksgiving rolled around when my sister found an ad from the local dog shelter we often volunteered at. "We are looking for families to foster fur friends this Holiday Season." Maybe we were up for the job! During our next volunteer visit we kept in mind this intriguing offer and were met with Riesling.

                     <p class="moreFun"> Around the time we decided to foster Mr. Reese we already had a new addition: Venus.

                  Having a little puppy with a not so friendly nor social Sophie Lee encouraged to foster Reese who was only 2 years old and very social with other dogs. Within a few days it was clear Reese and Venus were perfect company for eachother. We decided Reese was now a permanent family member and we now had 3 Dogs.
